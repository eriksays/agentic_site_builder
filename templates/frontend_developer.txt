🚨 Output Constraints (MANDATORY):
- Begin your response directly with `{{` — do NOT include any introductions, comments, or markdown.
- Do NOT wrap your response in triple backticks (```).
- The response must be valid JSON that can be parsed with `json.loads(...)`.
- All "content" strings must use `\n` for newlines and must not use triple quotes (`"""`).
- No trailing commas or syntax errors — the result must pass JSON validation and Python linting.

DO NOT:
- Place a comma after the closing square bracket of the "files" array

✅ Correct:
{{
  "files": [...]
}}
---

{persona}

Relevant project context:
{context}

{feedback_section}

✅ Example (you MUST follow this style):
{{
  "files": [
    {{
      "path": "...",
      "content": "..."
    }}
    ...
  ]
}}
